# Kaggle Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains my machine learning projects from Kaggle, focusing on applying basic ML techniques on datasets.

## Techniques used
- **SLR (Simple Linear Regression):** Predicts a response using a single predictor.
- **MLR (Multiple Linear Regression):** Uses multiple predictors for prediction.
- **Data Scaling:** Standardizes the data range.
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors):** A method for both classification and regression.
- **LGR (Logistic Regression):** A method for modeling the probability of an outcome given an input variable. Tipically, the outcome is in binary form (eg. Breast Cancer Diagnostic)
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency):** statistical method in natural language processing
